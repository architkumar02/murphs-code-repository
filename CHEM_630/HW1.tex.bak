\question{Advanced Topic - Extended Periodic Table}
The periodic table (a method of organizing elements while prediciting properties and existnace) was proposed by Dimitri Mendeleev in 1869. 
Since then, elements have been continious added to the table.
Livermorium and flerovium (\isotope[116]{Lv} \& \isotope[114]{Fl}) have become the most recent additions to the periodic table (May 31, 2012) while the 2010 discovery of ununseptium has yet to be verified.
The prediticive properties of the periodic table have been used to aid in the search for elements, thus, the exact number of possible elements is an active reasearch question.
Feynman calculated that elements with a Z greater than 137 the ground state energy of the 1s electron would become imaginary and thus occilatory. This by itself does not rule out elements with a Z greater than 137, it just means that the atoms would be charged. 
In fact, when this calculation was revisited with a better model of the atom the 1s orbital energy remained positive until Z around 150.
A recent model of the periodic table has been created for Z $\le$ 172, based on updated computer models. These predicted, super heavy elements have been yet to be found, but have orbitals in the 6f and 5g, extending period 8.
