Link Analytics Challenge
(invsiable edge problem)

PROBLEM:
 - Call Detail Records
    - every call that involved a cricket customer
    - Have social networks model as graphs
        - Graph (nodes are people, edges are calls)
        - cell phone networks don't have all of the nodes/edges
        - Undirected graph
    - Clique in a graph
    
    - Yes/No for several hundred thousand graphs
        - Esimate the probablity that an edge exists between two nodes
        
    - Test
        - Given and edge list of all nodes
            - 1 if edge should be there
            - 0 if edge should not be there

PROBLEM SIZE:
    - On average 3 friends, but some have a very high degree (power law dist)
    
DELIVERABLES:
 By the end of class (3:25pm) on Tuesday, Dec 4 your group will submit (via blackboard) the follow items:

    - A 5-page report for your group's strategy/approach to the Challenge problem. Your report (submitted as a PDF file) should include a title page listing all authors, your team number, and a short abstract summarizing your approach and conclusions. Your report should also include a bibliography of all references (including websites/software) used. Responses to some/all of the questions posed in Section 2 of the Challenge description are encouraged. Be sure to state the actual questions addressed in your report.
    - Three PowerPoint slides that summarize your group's approach to the Challenge and observations and insights you gained.
    - The prediction file described in Section 3 of the Challenge description.
    - Software used to produce the prediction files (zip file will suffice).
    (Group 11 J. Martin, M. Urffer, L. Wan)
    
IDEAS:
    - Friend sets don't change monthly (structure should be about the same)
    - Is graph connected / ways to compress graph
    - How many hops away
   
Need to show more on how the problem was thought about

Think that this is like a market basket 
- differnet attributes determine if another item exist (is bought)
