\section{Methods}
The call graph was provided as a labeled edge list, and was modeled as a weighted, undirected, multigraph \footnote{Using a multigraph will make it hard to compute distances}.
The graph was organzied as each of the nodes being the unique identifier to a cutomer, with edges between the customers representing:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \tt{days} - the number of distinict days that the two nodes communicated during the month,
	\item \tt{calls} - the number of distinct calls that the the nodes made during the month,
	\item \tt{secs} - the cummulative sum of all calls that the modes made during the month and,
	\item \tt{texts} - the number of distinct texts that the two nodes made during the month.
\end{itemize}

\todo{ANN}
The must learn (based on some properities) if an edge is there or not.
