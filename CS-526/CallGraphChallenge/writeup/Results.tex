\subsection{LSA Based Similarity Measure}

\subsection{Artifical Neural Network Classification}

The artifical neural network trained to a very low (less than 1\%) error using 5-fold cross valdiation and back-propogation in 20 itterations. 
However, when tested the accuracy of predicting wether a node existed or not was 51\%.  This low accuracy is no better than flipping a coin.
This is because the neural network was not feed any negative class examples; all the network had to learn was that an example input pattern corresponded to an edge.
Negative input patters could not be created as network input because there is no guarentree that the input pattern would not exists, thus the network could be taught incorrect data.
