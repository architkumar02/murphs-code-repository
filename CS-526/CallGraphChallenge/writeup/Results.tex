\subsection{LSA Based Similarity Measure}

\subsection{Artificial Neural Network Classification}

The artificial neural network trained to a very low (less than 1\%) error using 5-fold cross validation and back-propagation in 20 iterations. 
However, when tested the accuracy of predicting whether a node existed or not was 51\%.  This low accuracy is no better than flipping a coin.
This is because the neural network was not feed any negative class examples; all the network had to learn was that an example input pattern corresponded to an edge.
Negative input patters could not be created as network input because there is no guarantee that the input pattern would not exists, thus the network could be taught incorrect data.
