\section*{Acknowledgments}
The conversations with Alan Nam of how to best use the LIBSVM library for the use of this project were extremely helpful.
In addition Mike Franklin provided valuable comments on the structure of this project.
Thanks are also due to Erica Lansberg for proof reading and editing, and to Eli Urffer (my little brother) for providing encourgement.

Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank both Dr. Parker and Mike for the tremendous job they did teaching machine learning.
As an engineer I came into the class not knowing exactly what to expect, but left feeling that I have learned useful skills.
