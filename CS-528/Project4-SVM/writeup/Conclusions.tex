\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:Conclusions}

Support vector machines were implemented on unbalanced data sets

The effect of having a large $\sigma$ can be observed by examining Figures \ref{fig:ParamLiver}, \ref{fig:ParamGlass} and \ref{fig:ParamGlass}.
Larger values of $\sigma$ tended to have a low accuracy, while too high a value tended to also have a low accuracy. 
Relatively large values of $\sigma$ are then suited for the ensamble methods because they tend to be represenative of an RBFSVM which a relativly weak learning ability which generalizes better.
\subsection{Future Work}
Future work might be to change to use the decision value instead of the output class.
