Support vector machines were implemented on unbalanced data sets using the LIBSVM library.
The AdaBoostM1 algorithm was implemented as an ensemble learning method, and the accuracy of the ensemble method was compared to that of the individual support vector machines.
The effect of having a large $\sigma$ can be observed by examining Figures \ref{fig:ParamLiver}, \ref{fig:ParamGlass} and \ref{fig:ParamGlass}.
Larger values of $\sigma$ tended to have a low accuracy, while too high a value tended to also have a low accuracy. 
Relatively large values of $\sigma$ are then suited for the ensemble methods because they tend to be representative of an RBFSVM which a relatively weak learning ability which generalizes better.
