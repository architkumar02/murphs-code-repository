\begin{abstract}
Support vector machines were investigated for there use in single class and multi-class classification problems.
The radial basis function was used as the kernal for, and the classifiers where trained for a variety of kernal size and regularization paramater in order to find the optimal classifier parameters for a single data set.
After the optimal value were found for a single classifier the AdaBoostM1 algorthim was implemented and an ensamble of weak learners was trained.
The ensamble classifier trained with AdaBoostM1 had a higher accuracy than the single support vector machine for the Glass and Liver data set.
The vowel data set, however, had a very high accuracy (96\%) for the single classifier while the ensamble classifiers preformed poorly.
As the vowel data set was the only example of a balanced data set while the other's were unbalanced data sets, it can be concluded that the AdaBoostM1 algorthim improves the performance of a classifier on an unbalanced data set.
