\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Support vector machines (SVM) were investigated for their use in single class and multi-class classification problems.
The radial basis function was used as the kernel function, and the classifiers were trained for a variety of kernel sizes and regularization parameters in order to find the optimal classifier parameters for a single data set.
After the optimal value was found for a single classifier, the AdaBoostM1 algorithm was implemented and an ensemble of weak learners was trained.
The ensemble classifier trained with AdaBoostM1 had a higher accuracy than the single support vector machine for the Glass and Liver data set.
The vowel data set, however, had a very high accuracy (96\%) for the single classifier while the ensemble classifiers preformed poorly.
As the vowel data set was the only example of a balanced data set while the others were unbalanced data sets, it can be concluded that the AdaBoostM1 algorithm improves the performance of a classifier on an unbalanced data set.
