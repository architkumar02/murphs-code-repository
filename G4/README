RangeSim
  The simulation of primary particle ranges in different materials. This
  project contains a comparison to the NIST Values (based on downloaded 
  data) that (in addition) creates a xls file for easy data interpratation.
  This simulation is based on the example of TestEM1, and was used for the 
  valiation of Andrew Mabe's TRIM calculations

OptEnergyDeposition
  Finds the Energy Depsotion in films
  Geometry is a single film layer with a single spaer layer

SecElectronDistribution
  Calculates the electron energy distribution of films
  Geometry is a single film layer with a single spaer layer
  Also contains ComptonScatter, which is the analtytical ComptonScattering
