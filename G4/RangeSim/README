RANGESIM

A GEANT4 Toolkit designed to simulate the ranges of particles in matter.

TO RUN:
> export G4WORKDIR=$(pwd)
> make
> ./bin/Linux-g++/rangeSim val_erange.mac > out_val_erange.txt
> ./bin/Linux-g++/rangeSim val_erange.mac > out_val_erange.txt
> ./bin/Linux-g++/rangeSim range.mac > out_range.txt
> python Analysis.py 

FILES:
  + GNUmakefile     - Makefile for the simulation
  + range.mac       - macro file to simulate the energies and particles of
                      that are defined in rangeRuns.mac for materials
  + rangeRuns.mac   - types and energies of particles to simulate
  + rangeSim.cc     - main source file of the simulation
  + README          - this file
  + val_arange.mac  - macro file for the validation of the alpha ranges
  + val_erange.mac  - macro file for the validation ot the electron ranges
  + Analysis.py     - python script to preform formated analysis

DIRECTORIES:
  + include   - header files for the simulation code
  + src       - source files for the simulation code
  + NIST_DATA - downloaded alpha and electron CSDA range from NIST
