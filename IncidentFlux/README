Purpose of this study is to determine the incident flux of the neutron and
gamma sources for varius radi (2.54 and 1.2 cm) and thickness

Bugs:
  2013-04-03 I forgot to change the materials to a non-absorbering (so I wonder what affect this will make)
Changelog:
  2013-04-02 Started working on this
  2013-04-03 Submitted jobs to queue system
  2013-06-24 Cleaning up and README work

TO RUN:
  > ./RUNDATA.sh   # Generates data for the Neutron and Gamma incident flux
  > ./runPtSurc.sh # Generates data for a point source

ANALYSIS:
  > python analysis.py
    - Reads the run output (*.o) and creates two xls files containing a summary
    of the run data. The two excel files are GammaAnalysis.xls and 
    NeutronAnalysis.xls

HELPER FILES:
  - gPointScript.sh  - generates MCNPX input decks for the gamma point source
  - gRunScript.sh    - generates MCNPX input decsk for the gamma irridiator
  - nRunScript.sh    - generates MCNPX input decks for the neutron irridiator
  
  nRunScript.sh and gRunScript.sh are both called by RUNDATA.sh.

DATA FILES:
  - SimulatedData.tgz results of the simulation
