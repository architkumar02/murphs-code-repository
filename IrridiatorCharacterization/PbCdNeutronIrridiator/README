PbCdNeutronIrridiator

The purpose of this is to complete MCNPX simulations of the neutron irridiator

SIMULATIONS FILES:
  HDPEGamma.mcnp - Gamma energies from the Cf-252 through HDPE.  Purspose
    is to find the source of the gammas entrant into the wells

  Miller_Config_GS20_PbCdGamma.mcnp - Gamma and Neutron Particle tallies, 
    interaction rates, and fluxes in the lead and cadmium wells
 
  SphereTest.mcnp - Gamma and neutron tallies Cf-252 encased in HDPE.
    There is no shielding (no Pb, SS-316) around the Cf-252 source.
