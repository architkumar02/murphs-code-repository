SIMULATION OF LAYERED DETECTOR

  GS20Calibration:
    Calibration of the light yield and number of photons using GS20 glass

  SmallNeutronIrridiator:
    The irridiator is a Cf-252 source is the Pasqua characterization lab. 
    This irridiator does not have the lead and cadmium wells. The geometry
    for this irridiator was never validated.
  
  ThermalNeutronIrridiator:
    The irridiator is a Cf-252 source in the Pasuqa characterization lab 
    that typically houses the lead and cadmium wells in order to determine
    the thermal neutron response.  For the layered detector measurements and
    simulations, however, both of the wells were removed.

      See Matthew's second lab notebook, pg  134.
  
  GammaSource:
    THe gamma source used in the layered detector mesurments.  The orginal
    geometry is described on pg. 133 of Matthew's second lab notebook.

MATERIALS:

Currently only the EJ-426 is physical.  Probably should check the material composition
