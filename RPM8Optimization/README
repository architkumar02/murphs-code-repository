Optimization of the RPM8 based on MCNPX simulation
Author: Matthew J. Urffer

ABOUT:
    This project was started in the begining of Febuary, 2013. It was orginally
intended as a c code to generate the input decks, but this approach was 
abandonded in order to make the input deck more portable. The calling structure
is as follows:

    RUNDATA.sh calls createInputDeck.sh, which uses SCRIPT.mcnp as the base
    RUNDATA.sh copies the contents of queueRunScript.sh into a temp file which
        is then submitted to the job queue
    Data parsing is done with the python script

CHANGELOG:
   2/08/2013 - Started createInputDeck.sh
   2/09/2013 - Finished createInputDeck.sh


FILES:
    README              - this fileE
    RUNDATA.sh          - main driver for running the simulations
    createInputDeck.sh  - creates the input deck based off of SCRIPT.mcnp
    SCRIPT.mcnp         - base of all of the MCNP input decks
    queueRunScript.sh   - base file for jobs submitted to the queue system
    paraseOutput.py     - parses the output mctal files

RUN OUTPUT:
    2013-02-09_RunOutput.tgz 
        linear spacing with a front modeterator spacing of 2.5 cm, the number
        of detector layers going from (1 2 3 4), and the spacing between the
        detector assemplies ranging from (1 2 3 4) cm.
