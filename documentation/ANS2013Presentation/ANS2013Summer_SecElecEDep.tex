\subsection{Motivation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Single Collision Energy Loss}
How much energy does an electron lose in a collision?
  \newtheorem{thm1}{Single Collision Energy Loss Definition}
  \begin{thm1}<1->
    \small
    Interaction of an electron of kinetic energy E with water can be described by the probability $N(E,E')dE$ that it loses an amount of energy between $E'$ and $E'+dE$
  \end{thm1}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item $N(E,E')$ is the single collision spectrum of $E$
    \item $N(E,E')$ is a normalized probability function
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}[fragile]{Motivation}
  Secondary Electron Range Calculations:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Low energy, high fidelity low energy electron transport needed for gamma discrimination simulation
    \item GEANT4 (with \verb+G4DNAPhysics+) provide the ability to simulate low energy electron interactions
    \item Ability to validate GEANT4 simulation
  \end{itemize}
  Neturon - Photon Discrimination:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Secondary electrons from gamma interactions will have a higher energy than reaction products from neutorn interactions
    \item Higher energies imply a partial energy deposition, thus ability for pulse height discrimination
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Project Goal}
  \centering
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Validate GEANT4 simulation method by reproducing single collision energy loss spectra
    \item Apply this simulation to energy deposition in films
  \end{itemize}
  \begin{figure}
    \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{Turner_Fig2_SingleCollisionELoss}
  \end{figure}
  \flushleft
  \small
  Example:
  \begin{itemize}
    \tiny
    \item For \SI{10}{\keV}, the average value of the single collision energy loss between \SI{45}{\keV} to \SI{50}{\keV} is 0.1 $\text{eV}^{-1}$
    \item Interval is \SI{5}{\keV}, so 5\% chance that a \SI{10}{\keV} electron in water has an energy loss between \SI{45}{\keV} and \SI{50}{\keV} in it's first collision
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{frame}{Monte Carlo Simulation Modeling}
Why Monte Carlo Simulation?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Can model the physical event
  \item Analytical solutions are hard
\end{itemize}
Why GEANT4?
\begin{itemize}
  \item Develop familarity with the toolkit
  \item GEANT4 has the ability to model low energy electrons
  \item GEANT4 has the ability to model light transport
\end{itemize}
\centering
The single collsion energy loss is a simple simulation with all of the energy transfer componenets necessary for detailed detector energy depostion.

\section{Methods}
\subsection{GEANT4}
\begin{frame}[fragile]{GEANT4 Introduction}
What GEANT4 is:
\begin{itemize}
  \small
  \item \href{geant4.cern.ch}{geant4.cern.ch}
  \item Free software package for the simulation of the passage of particles through matter
  \item Essentially a collection of tools for geometry, materials, physics models, events and digitization, visualizations $\dots$
  \item Maintained by the CERN community, widely used in physics
\end{itemize}
What GEANT4 is not:
\begin{itemize}
  \small
  \item For the timid
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Users are responsible for correctly implementing their own physics
    \item Users are responsible for correctly implementing their own analysis
  \end{itemize}
  \item Stagnant - major release are still occurring
\end{itemize}

  \begin{itemize}
    \item A microdose model for modeling early biological damage by ionizing radiation on the DNA scale
    \item Electron interactions include: elastic scattering (\SI{7.4}{\eV}), electronic excitation (\SI{9}{\eV}), ionization (\SI{11}{\eV}), vibrational excitation (\SI{2}{\eV})
    \item Similar methods exist for the protons, alphas
    \item Only material defined is \verb+G4_WATER+ (NIST based)

  \end{itemize}
  Energy Deposition in Thin Polymers:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \SI{0.25}{\eV} neutrons and \iso[60]{Co} photons shot into \iso[6]{LiF} loaded polymer
    \item Energy deposition calculated for each event, binned over a run
