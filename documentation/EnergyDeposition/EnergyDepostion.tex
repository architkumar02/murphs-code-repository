\include{Introduction}
This document is organzied as follows.
A brief overview of the interaction of charged particles in matter will be provided in Section \ref{sec:PreviousWork}, as well as some prelimary experiments demonstrating the range of secondary electrons to aid in neutron-gamma discrimination.
Next, the use of the GEANT4 toolkit for the modeling of the energy depostion will be discussed, as well as the validation of the model in Section \ref{sec:Methods}.
In the \ref{sec:Results} the results of this model applied to a single film will demonstrate the enhanced ability of neutron-gamma discrimination through secondary electrons.
