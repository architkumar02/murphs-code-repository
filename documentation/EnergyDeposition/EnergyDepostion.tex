\include{Introduction}
This document is organized as follows.
A brief overview of the interaction of charged particles in matter will be provided in Section \ref{sec:PreviousWork}, as well as some preliminary experiments demonstrating the range of secondary electrons to aid in neutron-gamma discrimination.
The GEANT4 toolkit was used for the modeling of the energy deposition.  Section \ref{sec:G4Intro} will provide an overview of the GEANT4 toolkit.
Section \ref{sec:Methods} will provide details on how the GEANT4 toolkit was implemented for this particular simulation, as well as providing validation of the calculations preformed by the GEANT4 toolkit in \ref{sec:SimValidation}
In the \ref{sec:Results} the results of this model applied to a single film will demonstrate the enhanced ability of neutron-gamma discrimination through secondary electrons.
