\section{Simulation Validation}
\label{sec:SimValidation}

GEANT4 is a toolkit implemented by the user so extensive efforts were completed in order to validate the results and ensure no bugs exists.
First steps were taken (for small runs) to compute the energy deposition for small runs by hand in order to make sure they agreeded with the analysis code.
In addition the reaction products of the \iso{Li}{6}$(\text{n},\alpha)$\iso{H}{3} were checked to make sure that they agreeded with the published values \footnote{GEANT4 4.9.2.p01 contains an error in which extra photons are generated, \hyperref{http://hypernews.slac.stanford.edu/HyperNews/geant4/get/phys-list/530.html}{SLAC hypernews}. This has been fixed in the release used, 4.9.5p1}.
The GEANT4 simulation was validated by comparing the single collision energy loss spectra in water and by comparing the simulation energy deposition to that of a measured spectra.


\subsection{Energy Deposition Validation}
The energy deposition was tested by reproducing the single collision energy loss spectra in water\footnote{%
An analysis class was not written for this simulation. 
Instead the verbosity of the simulation was set to \texttt{verbose=1} in the run macro.
The first ionisation collision (\texttt{e-\_G4DNAIonisation}) was then extracted with \texttt{sed -n '/ParentID = 0/,/e-\_G4DNAIonisation/p' G4OutputFileName.txt| grep "e-$\backslash$\_G4DNAIonisatioin" | awk '\$\{print \$5\}' }' %
}.
The \verb+PhysicsList+ was extended to include \verb+G4DNAPhysics+ and the detector material was set to the NIST definition contained in the toolkit with \verb+G4Material* H20 = man->FindOrBuildMaterial("G4_WATER")+.
In general there was excellent agreement between the simulated energy spectra and a previously published spectra\cite{turner_comparative_1982}.
The simulated spectra had much better resolution at fine energies (corresponding to discrete states) of which Turners did not.

\subsection{Spectra Validation}
The simulated energy deposition is not the directly equivilant to light collected on the PMT because the scintillation process and light collection is not modeled.
However, it is well known that scintillation follows the energy deposition\cite{birks_scintillations_1951}.
Thus, up to scaling contants, the energy deposition can be considered equivilant to the scintillation and representative of the measured spectra.
Rather than attempting to back out these scaling contants the weighted average of spectra were used in which integration and normalization removes these fudge factors.
The simulation was validated by computing the weighted average of the energy deposition \ref{eq:AvgEnergyDepDefination} and comparing it to the spectra average defined in \ref{eq:AvgChannelNumberDefination}.
There is excellent agreement between the measured gamma weighted average (right ordinate axis) and the average energy deposition from a \iso{Co}{60} source (left ordinate axis).
Non-linearity is observed for films less than 200 \micron, this is evidance that the cascade electrons from the Compton electron are eneregetic enough that the range of the electrons is much greater than the thickness of the film and leave the film without colliding to an energy in which the energy deposition is linear (Figure ~\ref{fig:TurnerETransfer}).

The comparison between the average energy deposition and measured channel allows for the a relationship to be drawn between the energy deposited and the channel number.
This is completed by an taking an average of the ratio between the average channel number (Equation \ref{eq:AvgChannelNumberDefination} and the average energy deposition (Equation \ref{eq:AvgEnergyDepDefination}).
This ratio is defined in Equation \ref{eq:ChannelNumber}.  This quantity is defined seperately for neturons and gammas.
