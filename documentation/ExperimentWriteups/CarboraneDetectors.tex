\section{Introduction}

\iso[10]{B} is an attractive replacement neutron absorber ($\iso[10]{B}\left( n,\alpha \right ) \iso[7]{Li}$, Q-value \SI{2.78}{\MeV}, with only \SI{2.34}{\MeV} shared between the alpha and \iso[7]{Li}) for radiation portal monitors because of it's high thermal cross section (\SI{3800}{b}) and ability easily incorporate into an organic scintillator.
South Carolina State University (SCSU) has prepared several methylstyrene samples containing various amounts of carborane, ranging from 0\% to 5\%.
\autoref{tab:MSSampleComp} shows the composition of these samples.

\section{Measured Detector Performance}
The six methylstyrene samples were tested for their alpha, beta, gamma, and thermal neutron responses in the University of Tennessee's characterization laboratory.

\subsection{Light Yield}

The alpha spectra of the films were collected using an \iso[241]{Am} source with a (predominantly \SI{5.48}{\MeV}).
\autoref{fig:LYAlpha} shows the spectra for two extremes of the methylstyrene samples compared to a commercial boron loaded scintillator, while \autoref{fig:LYAlphaMS} provides a comparison for all of the measured SCSU methylstyrene samples. 
It is observed for all of the samples that an increasing boron content decreases the light yield.

  \label{fig:LYAlphaMS}
\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:LY} demonstrates the light yield from a variety of radiation sources represented by either the average of that spectra or the peak. 
The neutron average of EJ-254 1\% is 338 channels, with an alpha peak of 1,139 channels and a beta average of 765 channels.
Thus, the fabricated methylstyrene samples have a higher light output.
A rough estimate of the decrease in light yield can then be calculated from the 0\% carborane samples to the 5\% carborane samples; for alphas it is around 30\% while for \iso[60]{Co} gammas it is around 13\%, and for neutrons from 1\% to 5\% carborane there is almost 45\% decrease in the light output as calculated by the neutron average in the thermal well.

EJ-254 1\% has a published light output of \SI{9,200}{photons\per\MeV} which corresponds to a beta average of 765 channels.} 
  \label{fig:LY}
\end{figure}
\subsection{Neutron Performance}
The neutron performance of these detectors is shown in \autoref{fig:NeutronSpectra}.
The effect of adding carborane can be seen in the spectra where adding carborane tends to decrease the light yield of the sample, while increasing the total count rate.
It is also observed that these samples are brighter than the commercial EJ-254 1\% boron samples.
\autoref{fig:NCRperMass} shows the count rate of each carborane sample as a function of carborane loading, normalized by the mass of the sample. 
It is observed that very little gain in the total count is observed for four to five percent carborane loading, this is due to the self shielding and depletion of the neutron flux within the sample.
\autoref{fig:NCRper10B} shows the neutron count rate normalized by the mass of \iso[10]{B} in the sample, where the effects of self-shielding are clearly evident in the downward trend count rate per mass absorber as a function of carborane loading.

\section{Simulated Energy Deposition}
Carborane loaded samples were simulated with the GEANT4 toolkit.
The sample composition was approximated as \verb+G4_PLASTIC_SC_VINYTOLUENE+ loaded with the appropriate mass fraction of carborane.
Measurements of the density of the samples had a range of densities from \SI{0.98}{\gram\per\cm\cubed} to \SI{1.1}{\gram\per\cm\cubed} that did not display a clear trend with increasing carborane fraction; therefore all of the simulated film densities were set at \SI{1.0}{\gram\per\cm\cubed}.
The scintillator and wavelength shifter, PPO and bis-MSB, where not accounted for in the material composition as they consisted of \SI{10}{\gram\per\liter} and  \SI{0.5}{\gram\per\liter}, respectively.
The simulation geometry was a single sheet of the detector material.
Neutronic interactions were simulated by shooting thermal (\SI{0.25}{\eV}) neutrons at the detector, while \iso[60]{Co} was simulated by shooting two photons at the detector.

The energy deposition of each event was computed by summing all of the energy deposition of the steps in a track through the detector.
In the case where the primary particle did not interact with the detector material the energy deposition was zero, and such event were not binned (or included in the analysis).
\autoref{fig:SimEDepGamma} and  \autoref{fig:SimEDepNeutron} show the simulated energy deposition.
As expected, the gamma energy deposition closely follows an exponential law as shown by the linear trend on a log-log plot.
In addition, it is observed that up \SI{100000}{\m} \todo{better value} only 10\% of the \iso[60]{Co} energy is deposited in the film.
For neutrons, it is observed that a very thin film is necessary to capture over 90\% of the reaction product energies.
This is due to the reaction products being heavy and charged.
For comparison, the ratio of the fractional average energy deposition of neutrons compared to the fractional average energy deposition of the gammas is shown in \autoref{fig:SimEDepRatio}.

\section{Proposed Experiments}
It is proposed to recast one of the samples unto disk in order to limit the energy deposition of gammas and therefore improve the neutron - photon discrimination.
