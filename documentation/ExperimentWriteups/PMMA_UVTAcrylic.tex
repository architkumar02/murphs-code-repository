\section{Introduction}
Developed detector materials are often brittle and thus for repeatable characterization of the material it is often desired to cast the film unto a backing that can provide structural stability while not interfering with the measurements.
Acrylic plastic (polymethylmetharylate, PMMA) is a commonly used in fabricating light guides for plastic scintillators due to it's optical clarity and good mechanical properties and thus is a natural choice of a mounting material.
Generally the PMMA is available in two types, with or without ultra-violet (UV) absorbing materials added to the cast PMMA.
The UV absorbers are added for general purpose commercial applications and are the standard, and thus when the absorbers are omitted the material is know as UVT (ultraviolet transparent) Acrylic.
The effectiveness of the UV absorbers are shown in \autoref{fig:EJTransArcylic}.

\end{figure}	
It was observed in repeating the neutron fraction above the gamma LLD that there was significant discrepancy between a film mounted on a thin PMMA disc and a film mounted on a thick UVT (ultra-violet transparent) acrylic disc, as shown in \autoref{tab:PSFractionRepeatMeas}.
This effect was observed for two different film thickness (\SI{25}{\um} and \SI{50}{\um}) with each film being 10\% LiF in a polystyrene matrix.

It is observed from \autoref{tab:PSFractionRepeatMeas} that the gamma measurements as indicated by the MLLD are stable while the neutron count rate is not. 
It is shown in \autoref{fig:NeutronCountRateRepeat} that there is a distinct difference between the PMMA mounted and UVT mounted disc, with the PMMA mounted films having a much lower performance.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{UVTPMMA_CountRate}
  \caption[Neutron Spectra of UVT mounted and PMMA mounted films]{Neutron spectra of UVT mounted and PMMA mounted films.  It is evident that both UVT mounted films have the same endpoint (around 2,250 channels) while the PMMA films have a much lower neutron endpoint and a different spectra shape.}
  \label{fig:NeutronCountRateRepeat}
\end{figure}
Several different causes of this discrepancy were considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item energy deposition by charged particles not being fully absorbed in the film (and being adversely effected by the disc),
  \item light propagation through the acrylic disc being attenuated,
  \item and adverse chemical reactions in the PMMA disc.
\end{itemize}
It was quickly ruled out that the energy deposition by the reaction products could not be responsible.
As both materials are made of the same constituents it is reasonable to expect that the reflection of electron from the disc back unto the film would be very similar.
In addition, a \iso[36]{Cl} source was placed directly on the PMT and no counts above background were absorbed, thus making it unlikely that electrons were escaping the film and interacting directly with the photo-diode on the PMT.

\section{Methods}
From the arguments made above it was determined that the cause of this discrepancy must be either light propagation in the disc, different material compositions, or additional chemistry occurring between the cast film and disc upon which it is cast.
In order to determine if it was light propagation through the films two sets of experiments were completed in which it was attempted to replicate a PMMA film as mounted on a UVT disc, and a UVT mounted film as cast on a PMMA disc.
The second (after the first failure to provide a conclusive answer) was to fabricate two more films of the same composition and batch, measuring the emission and excitation of the disc before and after, along with the scintillation properties.

\subsection{Light Transport Experiment}
The premise of these experiments is to try and replicate the same light collection geometry with the existing films.
If the back of the film is mounted in a non light reflecting geometry, the light entering the PMT must pass through the disc upon which the mounting is being tested and thus the performance of that disc can be determined.
Two different sets of experiments were preformed in order to determine if light attenuation in the film caused the degradation in performance.
The first experiment was to try and reconstruct the measurement of a PMMA disc as if it was mounted on a UVT disc, and the second was to reverse the setup and try to replicate a PMMA film as if it was cast on a UVT arcylic disc.
The geometry of the four experiments is shown in \autoref{fig:LightAttenExp}.

The experiments shown in \autoref{fig:ExpA} and \autoref{fig:ExpC} are designed to provide the performance of the film without the effects of the PMMA or UVT disc, respectively.
In the experiment shown in \autoref{fig:ExpB} it is expected under this hypothesis that the performance of the film should be dramatically reduced by the PMMA disc.
The experiment shown in \autoref{fig:ExpD} is expected to have a higher light output than the base case in \autoref{fig:ExpC}.

\section{Results}

It was shown by measurements in a non-reflective geometry by coupling the PMMA or UVT acrylic discs to the film a significant loss in performance (above the loss due to additional layer of optical coupling) is not evident.

It is observed that the performance of the PMMA film is not enhanced by placing it atop of a UVT acrylic disc, and the performance of a film cast on a UVT acrylic is not significantly degraded up the placing it on PMMA disc. It is noted that some performance degradation is observed, but it not clear that this is below the effects of adding a additional layer of optical coupling.}

\section{Conclusions}

It might be best to get away from using the fraction of counts above the discriminator setting, as the denominator is highly dependent on the physical LLD.
