\section{Introduction}
Developed detector materials are often brittle and thus for repeatable characterization of the material it is often desired to cast the film unto a backing that can provide structural stability while not interfering with performance measurements.
Acrylic plastic (polymethylmetharylate, PMMA) is a commonly used in fabricating light guides for plastic scintillators due to it's optical clarity and good mechanical properties and thus is a natural choice of a mounting material.
Generally PMMA is available in two types, with or without ultra-violet (UV) absorbing materials added to the cast PMMA.
The UV absorbers are added for general purpose commercial applications and are the standard, and thus when the absorbers are omitted the material is know as UVT (ultraviolet transparent) Acrylic.
The effectiveness of the UV absorbers are shown in \autoref{fig:TransArcylic}.

It was observed in repeating the neutron fraction above the gamma LLD that there was significant discrepancy between a film mounted on a thin PMMA disc and a film mounted on a thick UVT (ultra-violet transparent) acrylic disc, as shown in \autoref{tab:PSFractionRepeatMeas}.
This effect was observed for two different film thickness (\SI{25}{\um} and \SI{50}{\um}) with each film being 10\% LiF in a polystyrene matrix.

It is observed from \autoref{tab:PSFractionRepeatMeas} that the gamma measurements as indicated by the MLLD are stable while the neutron count rate is not. 
It is shown in \autoref{fig:NeutronCountRateRepeat} that there is a distinct difference between the PMMA mounted and UVT mounted disc, with the PMMA mounted films having a much lower performance.

  \caption[Neutron Spectra of UVT mounted and PMMA mounted films]{Neutron spectra of UVT mounted and PMMA mounted films.  It is evident that both UVT mounted films have the same endpoint (around 2,250 channels) while the PMMA films have a much lower neutron endpoint and a different spectra shape.}
  \label{fig:NeutronCountRateRepeat}
\end{figure}
Several different causes of this discrepancy were considered:
\begin{itemize}
  \item energy deposition by charged particles not being fully absorbed in the film 
  \item light propagating through the acrylic disc and being attenuated,
  \item and adverse chemical reactions in the PMMA disc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}
In order to determine if it was light propagation through the films two sets of experiments were completed in which it was attempted to replicate a PMMA film as mounted on a UVT disc, and a UVT mounted film as cast on a PMMA disc.
The second experiment was to fabricate two more films of the same composition and batch, measuring the emission and excitation of the disc before and after, along with the scintillation properties.

\subsection{Light Transport Experiment}
The premise of these experiments is to try and replicate the same light collection geometry with the existing films.
If the back of the film is mounted in a non light reflecting geometry, the light entering the PMT must pass through the disc upon which the mounting is being tested and thus the performance of that disc can be determined.
Two different sets of experiments were preformed in order to determine if light attenuation in the film caused the degradation in performance.
The first experiment was to try and reconstruct the measurement of a PMMA disc as if it was mounted on a UVT disc, and the second was to reverse the setup and try to replicate a PMMA film as if it was cast on a UVT acrylic disc.
The geometry of the four experiments is shown in \autoref{fig:LightAttenExp}.

The experiments shown in \autoref{fig:ExpA} and \autoref{fig:ExpC} are designed to provide the performance of the film without the effects of the PMMA or UVT disc, respectively.
In the experiment shown in \autoref{fig:ExpB} it is expected under this hypothesis that the performance of the film should be dramatically reduced by the PMMA disc.
The experiment shown in \autoref{fig:ExpD} is expected to have a higher light output than the base case in \autoref{fig:ExpC}.

\end{figure}
\subsection{Film Fabrication Experiment}
In order to eliminate the possibility that poor performance of a film mounted on PMMA was due to anomalous fabrication five additional films (85\% PS, 10\% LiF, 5\% PPO-POPOP) were fabricated from the same batch.
The light yield of these films was then measured, as well as the determination of the neutron performance.
One of five \SI{50}{\um} films was mounted on a \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA, three were mounted on \SI{3}{\mm} UVT Acrylic PMMA, and the fifth was mounted on \SI{6}{\mm} UVT Acrylic PMMA.
The composition and sample number of the films are tabulated in \autoref{tab:FabFilmComposition}.

It was observed that the films cast upon the UVT acrylic have a rougher surface than the \SI{1}{\mm} film cast upon PMMA.

\section{Results}
Measurements in a non-reflective geometry suggest little evidence that light attenuation in the PMMA disc (above the loss due to additional layer of optical coupling) is the cause of the reduced performance.

It is observed that the performance of the PMMA film is not enhanced by placing it atop of a UVT acrylic disc, and the performance of a film cast on a UVT acrylic is not significantly degraded up the placing it on PMMA disc. It is noted that some performance degradation is observed, but it not clear that this is below the effects of adding a additional layer of optical coupling. See \autoref{fig:LightAttenExp} for the experimental descriptions.}

The measured spectra of the five fabricated films are shown in \autoref{fig:CompAm241} and \autoref{fig:CompCl36} for the alpha and beta responses.
It is observed that the \SI{6}{\mm} UVT PMMA has the lowest alpha response, while the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA is also slightly lower than the \SI{3}{\mm} samples.
The response to a \iso[36]{Cl} source shows a slightly different trend, with the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA film having the lowest light output, followed by the \SI{6}{\mm} UVT acrylic and finally the three \SI{3}{\mm} UVT acrylic.

The gamma response of the five measured PS films is shown in \autoref{fig:CompCo60}.
It is observed that all of the films have a very similar response\footnote{It is the opinion of the author is that the gamma spectra is not an accurate assessment of the performance of a film due to the lower probability of energy deposition in the film.}
The neutron spectra, \autoref{fig:CompCf252}, shows the the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA has a dramatically different neutron response than the other films in the series.
This measurement is repeatable (\autoref{sec:MeasRepeat}) while for clarity only one is shown.
The \SI{3}{\mm} UVT PMMA films all follow the same trends; their spectra look almost identical.
Finally, the \SI{6}{\mm} UVT PMMA also has a noticeable two peak spectra shape with the first peak around 250 channels and the second around 1000 channels.

\section{Conclusions}
It is evident that the neutron performance of the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA film has a much lower light output than the films mounted on UVT PMMA, while the light yield (as determined by an \iso[241]{Am} and \iso[36]{Cl}) of the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA is only slightly lower than the UVT acrylic films.
An interesting feature that is evident in the UVT acrylic films is a peak, slight trough, and then another shallow peak.
It is thought that the first peak is due to the energy deposition of the alpha (range \SI{10}{\um} in PS, \SI{2.05}{\MeV}) while the full energy deposition (adding in the triton of range \SI{62}{\um} and \SI{2.78}{\MeV}) occurs at the higher peak.
As the films are only \SI{50}{\um} thick it is probable that the alpha does not deposit all of it's energy in the film.

It is unclear why the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA has a dramatically different neutron spectral shape.
Attenuation of light in the disc would be expected to impact all of the light yields equally, and a substantial decrease is the light yield is not observed.
The repeatable low energy neutron peak suggests that complete energy deposition from the alpha is occurring, while the triton is not depositing any of its energy.
A possible cause of this might be the disc chemically interacting with the cast film, causing the film to be effectively thinner than designed.

The following films in \autoref{tab:1MMPMMAFilms} are cast upon a \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA disc, and as shown above their neutron performance measurement is suspect.
The neutron spectra of some of these films are plotted in \autoref{fig:1MMFilmsNetCf252}.
It is recommended not to use the \SI{1}{\mm} PMMA disc for neutron performance measurements.

\section{Measurement Repeatability}
\label{sec:MeasRepeat}
The conclusion that PMMA disc has a significantly lower neutron performance is supported by two measurements of the single prepared film.
The order of the measurements was Trial 1, then Sample 3, and then returning to Trial 1 once it was noticed that it deviated largely from Sample 3.
It is observed in \autoref{fig:MeasRepeatLY} that Trial 2 samples tend to have a higher light yield. 
This may be due to a slight temperate based changed in the electronic gains, or simply due to better coupling and light collection in Trial 2 compared to Trial 1.
However, the increase in light output is not observed in the gamma spectra, so if better coupling is the cause of the increased light output it would be expected that all of the Trial 2 data would be higher by the same amount.
The neutron spectra (\autoref{fig:MeasRepeatNeutron}) show excellent repeatability, and both spectra have the skewed shape.
