\section{Methods}

In the case of the mono energic point source the source is directly surrounded by HDPE, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:PointSrcGeo}. 
The \iso[252]{Cf} source is not presented as a bare point source.
Rather, the source is modeled as as a point \iso[252]{Cf} source sournded by 0.5 cm of lead. The lead sphere is then encased in HDPE as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:Cf252SrcGeo}.
In both source configurations the source is taken to be isotropic. 
For the point source was modeled for neutron energies of 1 eV, 1 keV, and 1 MeV.
The \iso[252]{Cf} source was modeled using the spontanous fission spectra built into MCNPX.

The thermal fraction is defined in \eqref{eqn:ThermalFraction} and was calculated by bining into two energy bins seperated by $5\times10^{-7}\text{MeV}$ (0.5 eV), normalizing by the total flux.
The thermal energy of 0.5 eV was chosen because this is the close to the cadmium cutoff.
\begin{align}
    \label{eqn:ThermalFraction}
    \eta = \frac{\int_0 ^{E_\text{termal}} \phi(E)dE}{\int_0^\infty \phi(E)dE}
\end{align}

\subsection{Simulation}
The neutronic simulations were completed in MCNPX. 
A generic MCNPX input deck was written for the point source (Listing ~\ref{lst:PointSrcScript}) and for the \iso[252]{Cf} source (Listing ~\ref{lst:Cf252SrcScript}).
A BASH script was then written in order to run multiple jobs, using \verb+sed+ to preform in place edits of the files.
For the point source this invovled itterating through a list of energies and then a list of distances.
The \iso[252]{Cf} source only involved itterating through a list of distances.
These scripts are shown in Listing ~\ref{lst:PointSrcRUNDATA} and Listing ~\ref{lst:Cf252SrcRUNDATA}.
