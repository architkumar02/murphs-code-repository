In the case of the mono energic point source the source is directly surrounded by HDPE, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:PointSrcGeo}. 
The \iso[252]{Cf} source is not presented as a bare point source.
Rather, the source is modeled as as a point \iso[252]{Cf} source sournded by 0.5 cm of lead and 2.5 cm of HDPE in order to replicate the test source used for testing radiation portal monitors.
In both source configurations the source is so
