In the case of the mono energic point source the source is directly surrounded by HDPE, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:PointSrcGeo}. 
The \iso[252]{Cf} source is not presented as a bare point source.
Rather, the source is modeled as as a point \iso[252]{Cf} source sournded by 0.5 cm of lead and 2.5 cm of HDPE in order to replicate the test source used for testing radiation portal monitors, as shown in Figure ~\ref{fig:Cf252SrcGeo}.
