\section{Light Scattering}

\subsection{Rayleigh Scatter}
Rayleight scattering applies to small particles, parsies whose size is much less than the wavelenght of incident light\cite{LightScat(3)(2)}:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:rayleigh}
\sqrt{\left \langle s^2 \right \rangle} < \lambda / 20
\end{equation}

Visiable light has $\lambda$ between  0.4 $\mu$m and 0.8 $\mu$m impliying that the particles must have a size smaller than 0.02 $\mu$m and 0.04 $\mu$m for Rayleigh scatting to be applicable.
\todo{Justify why size is smaller}
