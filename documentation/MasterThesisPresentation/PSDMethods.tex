		\small
		\item Determination of incident radiation from pulse shape
		\item Physical basis
		\begin{itemize}
			\tiny
			\item Difference in singlet ($S_1$) and triplet ($T_1$) states \cite{zaitseva_plastic_2012}
			\item Triple states annihilate: $T_1 + T_1 \to S_0 + S_1$
			\item Product states have a longer and delayed time scale
		\end{itemize}
		\small
		\item Short range of energetic protons (neutron interactions) cause a high concentration of triplet states than from electrons from gamma
		\item Lots of methods exist \cite{ambers_hybrid_2011, gamage_comparison_2011, miller_digital_2007}
		\begin{itemize}
			\tiny
			\item Charge Integration
			\item Pulse Gradient Analysis
			\item Neutron-$\gamma$ Modal Analysis
			\item Pulse Shape Parameters
			\item Artificial Neural Networks
			\item and more!
