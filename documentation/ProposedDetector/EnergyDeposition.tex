\section{Energy Deposition}

Energy deposition in the thin films was modeled using the GEANT4 toolkit.

Studies:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Energy Deposition through a film. Slice a film into 5 $\mu$m sections, calculate energy deposition. Repeat for total film thickness of 25,50,75,100,125,150 $\mu$m.
    \item
\end{itemize}
