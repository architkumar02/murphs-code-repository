\begin{frame}{PyEvolve Introduction}
	\begin{itemize}
  \small
  \item PyEvolve is a genetic algorithm framework written in pure python
  \item Genetic Algorithm Features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Crossover operations (single point, two point, uniform)
      \item Mutator operations (swap, flip)
      \item Selection operations (rank, uniform, tournament, roulette)
    \end{itemize}
  \item Additional Features:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Run statistics
      \item Convergence criteria
      \item Function callbacks
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}

	Representation of the the Genetic Algorithm
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{GSimpleGA} genetic algorithm
    \item \texttt{GPopulation} - the population
    \item \texttt{Initializators} - initialization methods
    \item \texttt{Mutators} - collection of mutator methods
    \item \texttt{Crossovers} - collection of crossover methods
    \item \texttt{Selectors} - collection of selection methods
  \end{itemize}
  Representation of an individual
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Bit string representation \texttt{10010101}
    \item Defined in \texttt{G1DBinaryString.py}
		\item Other representations are available (tree, 2D list)
  \end{itemize}
