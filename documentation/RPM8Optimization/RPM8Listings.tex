%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% LISTING CODE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\label{sec:RPM8Listings}
The creation of the input deck is managed by Listing ~\ref{lst:RUNDATA}.
This script uses Listing ~\ref{lst:MCNPScript} as the base MCNPX input deck.
The source cells are declared, as well as a token for which to insert the detector cells, which are dynamically generated by the python code in Listing ~\ref{lst:CreateSurfaceCell}.
The surface cells follow, along with a token for where the dynamically generated surfaces (planes) should be placed.
The run information finishes out Listing ~\ref{lst:MCNPScript}, as well as the token for placing the associated dynamically generated tallies for the detector cells the surface fluxes (Listing ~\ref{lst:CreateSurfaceCell}).
Listing ~\ref{lst:RUNDATA} also serves to submit jobs to the queue system by creating a job submission script for each run, based off of the code in Listing ~\ref{lst:QueueScript}.

Post processing of the output is completed with developed python code.
Listing ~\ref{lst:ParseOutput} runs through each of the MCTAL output files generated by MCNPX and creates a MCTAL python class for each one (Listing ~\ref{lst:mctal}).
A summary spreadsheet is generated, with additional sheets for the each of the runs.
