\begin{frame}{Design Constraints}
What do we mean by best?
\begin{itemize}
	\small
  \item Count rate? 
  \item Light output?
	\item Lowest cost / fabrication ease?
\end{itemize}
The design parameters were then:
\begin{itemize}
	\small
  \item The detector material
  \item The thickness of the detector material
  \item The spacing of detector layers
  \item The initial moderator thickness
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Previous Work}
\begin{frame}{Previous Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\small
	\item Have a working MCNPX model of the geometry
	\item Previous focused on a linear spacing of the films (simple)
	\item Have an idea on what thickness of moderator is necessary
		\begin{figure}

\begin{frame}{Summary}
Cost trade offs
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assumed \iso[6]{Li} was the most expensive part
	\item Fabrication cost for a complicated design might hinder this
	\item Is the space thick enough to get the light out?
\end{itemize}
