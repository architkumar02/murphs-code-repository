\begin{frame}{Optimization Formulation}
The optimization of the films was formulated as finding the minimum mass of \iso[6]{Li} for a given detector material necessary to fulfill an interaction rate of \SI{2.5}{cps\per\nano\gram\iso[252]{Cf}} while maintaining a intrinsic gamma rejection ratio of \num{1.e-6}.

  \item \verb+0+ - represents a moderator slice
  \item Example: \verb+001000+
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Each slice is \SI{2.12}{\centi\meter}
    \item Two slices of moderator, followed by one assembly slice followed by three additional slices of moderator

Cost trade offs
\begin{itemize}
	\item Assumed \iso[6]{Li} was the most expensive part
	\item Fabrication cost for a complicated design might hinder this
	\item Is the space thick enough to get the light out?
\end{itemize}
Can significantly reduce the amount of \iso[6]{Li} needed

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Improve performance on GA
	\small
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Can play with mutation rate and crossover rate
		\item Can play with population size and selection
		\item Use PyEvolve multiprocessing instead of mine - might remove code sensitivity
	\end{itemize}
	\normalsize
	\item Use a 1D transport code
	\item Run for different materials
	\item More runs at higher lengths
\end{itemize}
