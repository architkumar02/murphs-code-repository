The intrisinis efficiency is defined as \eqref{eqn:intEffDef} \cite{knoll_radiation_2009}.
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_{int} = \frac{N_c}{N_i}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \definevar{$\epsilon_{int}$}{intrisinic efficinecy},
  \item[] \definevar{$N_c$}{number of counts recorded by the detector}, and
  \item[] \definevar{$N_i$}{quanta of radiation incident upon the detector}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Neutron Intrinsic Efficiency}
The number of counts upon a detector is measured using the neutron irridiator facility.
The quanta of radiation incident upon the detector is found from MCNPX calculations.
This consits of two parts: 1) determining the number of neutrons crossing the detector surface in the lead and cadmium wells and, 2) determining the sourse strength.

The \iso[252]{Cf} source was \SI{0.59}{\ug} on July 2, 2009.
%Given that the half-life of \iso[252]{Cf} is 2.65 years and \iso[252]{Cf} has a spontanous neutron emission rate of \SI{2.3E6}{\neutron\per\second} the source strength at any given time can be calucalted as \eqref{eqn:cf252SourceStrength}.
