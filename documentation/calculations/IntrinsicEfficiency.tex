The intrisinis efficiency is defined as \eqref{eqn:intEffDef} \cite{knoll_radiation_2009}.
\begin{align}
  \epsilon_{int} = \frac{N_c}{N_i}
\end{align}
where:
\begin{itemize}
  \item[] \definevar{$\epsilon_{int}$}{intrisinic efficinecy},
  \item[] \definevar{$N_c$}{number of counts recorded by the detector}, and
  \item[] \definevar{$N_i$}{quanta of radiation incident upon the detector}.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Neutron Intrinsic Efficiency}
The number of counts upon a detector is measured using the neutron irridiator facility.
The quanta of radiation incident upon the detector is found from MCNPX calculations.
This consits of two parts: 1) determining the number of neutrons crossing the detector surface in the lead and cadmium wells and, 2) determining the sourse strength.

The \iso[252]{Cf} source was \SI{0.59}{\ug} on July 2, 2009.
%Given that the half-life of \iso[252]{Cf} is 2.65 years and \iso[252]{Cf} has a spontanous neutron emission rate of \SI{2.3E6}{\neutron\per\second} the source strength at any given time can be calucalted as \eqref{eqn:cf252SourceStrength}.

The gamma intrisinic efficiency was calculated that the sample was a cylinder of radius 1.27 cm, 2 mm thick in which the MCNPX calculations show 0.00909 photons cross the surface (the majority of them actually being from Co60 and not scattered photon - see attached)*. Scaling linear for the ratio of the areas yields 0.00909*(1.3 cm * 2.2 cm)/(pi*1.27cm^2) = 0.00527 photons per incident particle.  The source strength is 97 uCi on Jan 1st, but as it has a 30 year half life the half life correction was neglected, and the number of photons crossing the surface was calculated as 0.00527*97E-6Ci*3.7E10Bq/Ci = 18,867 photons per second.

The incident neutron quanta was calculated for also calculated for a 2 mm
