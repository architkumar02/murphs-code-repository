\section{Introduction}
Accurate knowledge of the range of a particle in a material is essentail for for the optimal design of a detector.
Knowing the range allows for the selective optimization of the energy deposition by making the detector material thick enough such that all of the particle will be stopped in the material, thus depositing all of it's energy.
Tabulated ranges exists for common materials, and codes such at TRIM and GEANT4 can be used for the calcuation of the range in differnet materials\cite{berger_estar_2005}.
The GEANT4 toolkit contains detailed electromagnetic models that can be adapted to calculate the ranges of primary particles.
An example provided with the toolkit, \verb+TestEm1+, provides the basis for calculating the ranges of electrons in aluminum. 
This work adapted that example for calculation of the ranges of in materials that are intresting for polymeric neutron detectors; namely \iso[6]{LiF} loaded polystyrene (PS), \iso[6]{LiF} loaded polyethylnapthalate (PEN), \iso[10]{B} loaded methylstyrene (MS), and \iso[6]{LiF} loaded zinc sulfide (EJ-426HD2).
This work will explain how the range is calculated with the GEANT4 toolkit, show how the validation of these calcualtions was completed, and then finally summerize the ranges for various material compounds of the reaction products of the \iso[10]{B} and \iso[6]{Li}.

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:Methods}

The GEANT4 toolkit handles primaries by events and runs. 
Each run is a specific geometry (including materials) and source particle - in this case a run is a particle gun of \SI{2.05}{\MeV} alphas into polystyrene, while another run is \SI{2.05}{\MeV} alphas into PEN.

The \verb+RunAction+ class collects the information for each run. 
In the \verb+BeginOfRunAction+ it initializes all of the variables needed (accumulation of track steps and track length), while at the end of the run it handles the display of the projected and CSDA ranges in \verb+EndOfRunAction+.
\verb+TrackingAction+ is the class that is called for each track, and it is where the actual range is computed.
The CSDA range value stored in \verb+RunAction+ is increased by the track length, while the projected range is incremented by the x component of the position.


\subsection{Validation Results}
\label{sec:ValResults}
The validation of the implemented physics list and the method of calculating the ranges was implemented by calculating the CSDA ranges for four differnet materials (aluminum, polystyrene, plastic scintillator (PVT based) and water) for various energies.
The calcualted ranges were then compared to the CSDA ranges listed on  NIST ASTAR and ESTAR by simply dividing the simulated range by the NIST range \cite{berger_estar_2005}.
A value of one indicates perfect agreement between the GEANT4 simulation and NIST, while values greater than one imply that the simulate range is greater than the NIST range, and values less than one signify that the simulated range is less than the NIST range.

\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:AlphaRangeVal} and \autoref{fig:ElectronRangeVal} show the validation of the alpha and electron ranges, respectively.
It is observed that for alpha particles the simulated range is generally a little bit higher than the NIST range, but for electrons it is less than five precent lower.
Due to the range straggling (indicated by the error bars) it is determined that these small differneces are insignicant, and that the simulation methodology is valid.

The data was compared to the TRIM calculations preformed by Andrew Mabe.
\subsection{Range of Selected Particles and Ions}
\label{sec:RangeResults}

A parametric study was completed on the how the range changes with increasing amount of absorber.
